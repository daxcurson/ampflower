I'll attempt to write a Music player that will connect to the media server Ampache. It will run on Android.

## Motivation

I'm not entirely satisfied with the existing music players, I was an avid user of Just Player but I can't find a more recent version so I thought, "How hard can it be?". So here we go!

## Platform

This software will be written in Java and will be intended for Android. The most recent versions of Android will be supported.

## Future features

This software will allow:
* Downloading from the ampache server and playing audio files.
* Reviewing and updating the catalog data of a file.
* Maybe play videos? Not sure about that...

## How to contribute

If you want to contribute, check out the code and submit a pull request, I'll be happy to review. You can also create issues to get my attention.
